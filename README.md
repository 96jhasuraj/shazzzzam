trying to make music matching work

#### What we will do: 
We will try 

- [X] Why dont we try strings like matching  ? 
    *  Plain Bad , but it helps realise that we need time invariant features
- [X] Do a image-based spectrogram embedding matcher ? 
    *  Okay so this is called template matching & it fails fot this task , but I had fun
    * Also i get the intution that we need to look for some signal which remains invariant of noise , maybe SIFT would help
- [ ] Build an image-based SIFT matcher on spectrograms ? 
- [ ] Implement Shazam fingerprinting hash
- [ ] Compare all 3 approaches ( make blog + GitHub)
